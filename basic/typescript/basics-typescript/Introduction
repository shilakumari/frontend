TypeScript:
	A programming langugae
	Free & Open-source
	Developed & maintained by Microsoft

Some problems with JavaScript
  1)Weak type checking
  2)Function arguments
  3)Cann't enforce structure of an object, No concept of template, Object are loosely structured
  4)Application complexity
	
Why JavaScript
	Browsers support only 
	

How TypeScript works
	During development time
		TypeScript Code--> TypeScriptCompiler--> JavaScript code-->Browser/NodeJS environment
		We can technically run the TypeScript compilation on browsers too. But it is very inefficient.
		
		TypeScript = JavaScript + Some additional feature(like types)
		TypeScript is superset of JavaScript.
		
WebAssembly

TypeScript
	Makes building these complex apps more manageable.
	Frameworks like Angular2+ is using it.
	
	
	
Setting up TypeScript
1)IDE: Visual Studio Code
2)Installing NodeJS
	node -v
