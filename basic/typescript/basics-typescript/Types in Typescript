JavaScript is dynamically typed
	Types may change during run-time
TypeScript is statically typed
	Types we defines during development time	
	
Type Casing:
In TypeScript, you work with types like string or number all the times. The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
	Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.

Question: What's the difference between JavaScript types (e.g. typeof 'Max' => 'string') and TypeScript types (e.g. const name: string = '...')?
Answer: JS has no compilation step but at runtime, you can check for certain types (e.g. in if conditions). 
	TS on the other hand allows you to catch certain errors during development since it checks types during compilation as well.


Basic Types
Number
	1
	1.5
String	
	""
	''
	``
Boolean
	true
	false

Type Assignment & Type Inference
	let number1;
	let number2:number;
	let number3=5;
	let number4:number=5;
		number4='Sachin';//CTE
		
	Types allow us to detect error early & avoid some runtime errors.
	Types allow you to detect if data of a wrong type is used or pass around, hence you can avoid unexpected runtime errors.
		const number1=10;
		console.log(typeof number1)
		if(typeof number1 !=='number'){
			throw new Error("Incorrect input");
		}
	Question: Does 'const age: number = 29;' code rely on type inference? 
	Ans: TypeScript would be able to infer the type (and hence you should omit ":number") but here, we actually also have an explicit type assignment.
	

Object Types
	{age:31}

	const person={
		name:"Shalu";
		age:25;
	}

	const person: object={
		name:"Shalu";
		age:25;
	}
	
	const person: {}={
		name:"Shalu";
		age:25;
	}

	const person:{
		name:string;
		age:number
	}={
		name:"Shalu";
		age:25;
	}


Nested Objects & Types
	const product = {
  			id: 'abc1',
  			price: 12.99,
  		    tags: ['great-offer', 'hot-and-new'],
		    details: {
		    	title: 'Red Carpet',
    			description: 'A great carpet - almost brand-new!'
  		}
	}
	This would be the type of such an object:
	{
  		id: string;
  		price: number;
  		tags: string[];
  		details: {
    		title: string;
    		description: string;
  		}
	}
  	console.log(product.details);
		//{title: "Red Carpet", description: "A great carpet - almost brand-new!"}  "_proto_":{.....}


Arrays Types
	Any JavaScript array (heterogeneous or homogeneous). Type can be flexible or strict (regarding the element types)
	
	const person = {
        name: 'Shila Kumari',
        age: 25,
        hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking']
        };
      
	let favoriteActivities: string[];
     	favoriteActivities = ['Sports'];

	let favoriteActivities: any[];
      	favoriteActivities = ['Sports',1];
      
    	for (const hobby of person.hobbies) {
        	console.log(hobby.toUpperCase());
        	// console.log(hobby.map()); // !!! ERROR !!!
      	}


Working with Tuples
	Fixed length array
	Added by typescript
	
	const person: {
        	name: string;
        	role: [number, string];
	} = {
        	name: 'Shila Kumari',
        	role: [2, 'author']
        };
	person.role.push('admin');
        console.log(person.role);//[2, "author", "admin"]
        person.role[0] = 10;
        //person.role[1] = 10;//CTE
        person.role = [0, 'admin', 'user'];//CTE
      

Working with Enums
 	Human readable named constant
 		enum {NEW,OLD}
 	Added by typeScript
 	Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers

	// const ADMIN = 'ADMIN';
	// const READ_ONLY = 100;
	// const AUTHOR = 'AUTHOR';
	enum Role { ADMIN = 'ADMIN', READ_ONLY = 100, AUTHOR = 'AUTHOR' };

	const person = {
		name: 'Shila Kumari',
  		role: Role.AUTHOR
	};

	console.log(person.name);
	if (person.role === Role.AUTHOR) {
  		console.log('is author');
	}

	
The "any" Type
	*
	Any kind of value, no specific type assignment
	
	let favoriteActivities: any[];
	favoriteActivities = ['Sports'];	
	

Union Types
	Use '|' operator for union types
	
	function combine(input1: number | string, input2: number | string){
		let result;
  		if (typeof input1 === 'number' && typeof input2 === 'number'){
    			result = input1 + input2;
  		}else{
   			result = input1.toString() + input2.toString();
  		}
  		return result;
	}

	const combinedAges = combine(30, 26);
	console.log(combinedAges);

	const combinedNames = combine('Max', 'Anna');
	console.log(combinedNames);
